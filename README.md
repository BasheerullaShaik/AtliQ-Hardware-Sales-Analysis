**Business Insights 360: Project Overview**

AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding electronics firm, encountered challenges in Latin America and required swift, data-driven decision-making. To address this, I developed a Power BI dashboard to enhance data analysis and decision-making across their Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain teams.

**Project Execution**

The project involved several key steps:
ðŸ”¸ Connecting the MySQL database to Power BI.
ðŸ”¸ Carefully validating and transforming the data.
ðŸ”¸ Adding calculated columns to improve analysis.
ðŸ”¸ Employing robust data modeling techniques.
ðŸ”¸ Building interactive dashboards.
ðŸ”¸ Regularly reviewing data and incorporating stakeholder feedback for continuous improvement.
